        "\n",
        "The objective of this research is to examine the linear relationship between the number of hours students dedicate to studying and their academic performance. By using regression analysis, the study aims to determine whether increased study time significantly predicts higher exam scores. This is significant for educators and policymakers aiming to understand how study habits affect learning outcomes.\n",

        "Previous studies have consistently shown that time spent studying can positively impact academic performance. However, other variables—such as socio-economic background, school quality, and student motivation—may also influence outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Studies using the **UCI dataset** have explored the relationship between various lifestyle factors (like alcohol consumption and study time) and grades.  \n",
        "- The **Kaggle dataset** highlights gender, parental education, and test preparation as performance influencers.\n",

        "This project fills the gap by isolating **study time** as the main predictor and quantifying its impact using **simple linear regression**.\n",
